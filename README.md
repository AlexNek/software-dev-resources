# Software Development Deep Dive: My Collection of Resources

## Overview
Okay, let's get straight to it. What I've assembled here is a summary of my work and the resources I've pulled together on software development. This is useful not only for developers but also for managers trying to navigate the complexities of software projects. We'll cover fundamental concepts, practical applications, and, of course, real-world code examples and open-source projects. And just so you're aware, all the information related to Blazor is located [here](https://github.com/AlexNek/Blazor-for-You)

## Articles
[Building Software Right: It's More Than Just Coding](SDLC/readme.md) 
Project managers often find themselves facing challenges with software development, but they aren’t always sure where to begin. This article is for them. It gives a view of how software development is handled today. We'll talk about the importance of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), why defining the problem accurately is key, why using agile methods is good, why clean code is important, and why DevOps is a must-have. Finally, we’ll look at keeping the user in mind, knowing that software development is always ongoing, and how to manage the whole process.

[AI for Programmers](https://github.com/AlexNek/AI-for-Programmers) Whether we need artificial intelligence right now is a frequent discussion. Some think it’s essential, while others see it as just hype. As is often the case, the reality is likely somewhere in between. AI is becoming more and more a part of modern software development. It can really help with productivity through automating tasks and assisting with solving hard problems. But, we need to understand both its capabilities and its limits to use AI effectively. Developers need to be aware of these things to apply AI correctly.

[Domain Driven Desing (DDD) for developers](https://github.com/AlexNek/ddd-for-developers) While there is extensive information available on DDD, I found it difficult to locate a brief explanation of the differences between DDD and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), and how these changes impact developers. I’ve extracted and collected key information to give software developers a quick understanding of these differences. We'll discuss: When DDD might be useful, DDD vocabulary, How to model business processes, Application examples, and include links to relevant books and videos.

## Examples

[Working example Event Sourcing](https://github.com/AlexNek/TrackingShips)  - This shows a working example of Event Sourcing, which is talked about on Martin Fowler's blog.

[Buber dinner](https://github.com/AlexNek/buber-dinner) - This repository is based on Amichai Mantinband's course on REST API DDD CLEAN ARCHITECTURE, and it’s a good place for those learning to build APIs.

[Folder Observer](https://github.com/AlexNek/FolderObserver) - C# WPF application sample or how to write well designed software application. 

## Helper tools
[Serilog sink for graylog in GELF format](https://github.com/AlexNek/Serilog.Sinks.GraylogGelf) - This extension is for sending log data from Serilog to Graylog using the GELF format. Options could be placed outside the code in the configuration file.

[BinaryStorage library (BiSto)](https://github.com/AlexNek/bisto) - The BinaryStorage library (BiSto) provides an efficient, block-based binary storage interface, enabling advanced management and manipulation of binary data in a structured manner.

[CommonDialogs MAUI](https://github.com/AlexNek/CommonDialogs.MAUI) - This provides common dialogs for MAUI applications, like file and folder selection.
